============
Software Development Proposal - Web application to automate, organize and streamline the deal flow for Lauth Investigation Sales team. With a single centralized dashboard Lauth Investigations Teams will be able to complete deals quicker and more efficiently.

## Problem
In order to complete the deal flow process for sales team members, there are many steps requiring data entry across many software tools. Additionally on the contact side of the process many phone calls are made and each step is at risk of a step falling through or bottlenecking.
Approximately 30 minutes per case is lost due to excessive data entry, switching between CRMs, phone calls and followup procedures.

---

## Solution & Goals
Build a custom web application centralized dashboard that integrates with 5+ CRM and misc tools, automates excessive data entry and phone call tasks, and notifies all parties via electronic notifications each step of the process all at the click of a button.

Goal # 1: Eliminate excess and repetitive data entry (CRM / Google Forms / Excel Spreadsheets).
Goal # 2: Eliminate/Reduce the need for phone calls that require client or salesperson to ask for update such as "Did you send this?" via notifications. 
Goal # 3: Integrate state form templates of paperwork each state requires specific to them.

Dominos has a pizza tracker function. We would be using this as a base visual influence for progress tracking.
